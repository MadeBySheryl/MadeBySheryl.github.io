		<span class="Talk01">New Album?</span>


		<span class="copy01">Hey has anyone heard anything about the new album that they say they're working on. All I know is that they said it was going to be heavy and that they were going to go back to making hard rock songs that were "longer and grittier". They said they were going to go into the studio a month ago but I haven't heard anything. Has anyone heard anything worthy enough of starting an article about? September 21, 2009 MJM<br>
Yh on 5 Nov i got a message from facebook from the avenged sevenfold page. It said album update from zacky v and all this is from the message- It has been awhile since we have shed light on our current doings. Well here is a long awaited update into the world of A7X..<br>

We came off of the road amidst one of the most turbulent times in history. Everything going on around us was overwhelming, frightening, frustrating and confusing. I must confess that it was also very exciting to me. I’m sure you can share my sentiment. We have been focused on only one thing, writing and preparing to record what to me is our most personal and epic Avenged Sevenfold album. The reason is the fact that everything happening around us in the entire world might be a once in a life time source of inspiration and direction. We have been harnessing every aspect of what makes A7X truly unrelenting and building off of that. I don’t think we sleep too much anymore because of the excitement we feel while writing this album. Only a world spinning out of control could inspire the music and vision we have now. Once again it is fucking exciting. We will continue finalizing our songs until we feel every note does both You as well as Us justice. We are also in the final stages of solidifying our production team, studios and engineers so that the second the axe falls and the album is written we will spend day and night in the studio until it is complete. This album will definitely take you on a very dark journey... Sincerely Zacky Vengeance</span>

<span class="Talk02">Rock vs Heavy Metal
 </span>


<span class="copy02">Avenged Sevenfold is classified more as rock than heavy metal. Aceusa (talk) 03:54, 17 November 2020 (UTC) <u>[reply]</u> <br>
Wikipedia is based on WP:SECONDARY sources. We summarize for the reader what has been published about the topic.
